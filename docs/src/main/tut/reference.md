# Reference

For the most up to date list of UDFs, look at API documentation for @scaladoc[`RasterFunctions`][RasterFunctions]. These UDFs are also registered with the SQL engine under the same name but with a `rf_` prefix (e.g. `dataCells` becomes `rf_dataCells`). 

The full API documentation can be found [here][scaladoc].
