# Overview

RasterFrames provides a DataFrame-centric view over arbitrary EO data, enabling spatiotemporal queries, map algebra raster operations, and compatibility with the ecosystem of Spark ML algorithms. It provides APIs in @ref:[Python, SQL, and Scala](languages.md), and can horizontally scale from a laptop to a supercomputer, enabling _global_ analysis with satellite imagery in a wholly new, flexible and convenient way.

## Context

We have a millennia-long history of organizing information in tabular form. Typically, rows represent independent events or observations, and columns represent measurements from the observations. The forms have evolved, from hand-written agricultural records and transaction ledgers, to the advent of spreadsheets on the personal computer, and on to the creation of the _DataFrame_ data structure as found in [R Data Frames][R] and [Python Pandas][Pandas]. The table-oriented data structure remains a common and critical component of organizing data across industries, and is the mental model employed by many data scientists across diverse forms of modeling and analysis.

Today, DataFrames are the _lingua franca_ of data science. The evolution of the tabular form has continued with Apache Spark SQL, which brings DataFrames to the big data distributed compute space. Through several novel innovations, Spark SQL enables interactive and batch-oriented cluster computing without having to be versed in the highly specialized skills typically required for high-performance computing. As suggested by the name, these DataFrames are manipulatable via standard SQL, as well as the more general-purpose programming languages Python, R, Java, and Scala.

RasterFramesÂ®, an incubating Eclipse Foundation LocationTech project, brings together Earth-observing (EO) data analysis, big data computing, and DataFrame-based data science. The recent explosion of EO data from public and private satellite operators presents both a huge opportunity as well as a challenge to the data analysis community. It is _Big Data_ in the truest sense, and its footprint is rapidly getting bigger. According to a World Bank document on assets for post-disaster situation awareness[^1]:

> Of the 1,738 operational satellites currently orbiting the earth (as of 9/[20]17), 596 are earth observation satellites and 477 of these are non-military assets (ie available to civil society including commercial entities and governments for earth observation, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists). This number is expected to increase significantly over the next ten years. The 200 or so planned remote sensing satellites have a value of over 27 billion USD (Forecast International). This estimate does not include the burgeoning fleets of smallsats as well as micro, nano and even smaller satellites... All this enthusiasm has, not unexpectedly, led to a veritable fire-hose of remotely sensed data which is becoming difficult to navigate even for seasoned experts.

## Benefit

By using DataFrames as the core cognitive and compute data model for processing EO data, RasterFrames is able to deliver sophisticated computational and algorithmic capabilities in a tabular form that is familiar and accessible to the general computing public. Because it is built on Apache Spark, solutions prototyped on a laptop can be scaled to run on cluster and cloud compute resources in a way not easily achieved with other toolchains.

## Architecture

RasterFrames takes the Spark SQL DataFrame and extends it to support standard EO operations. It does this with the help of several other LocationTech projects:
[GeoTrellis](https://geotrellis.io/), [GeoMesa](https://www.geomesa.org/),
[JTS](https://github.com/locationtech/jts), and
[SFCurve](https://github.com/locationtech/sfcurve) (see below).

![LocationTech Stack](static/rasterframes-locationtech-stack.png)

RasterFrames introduces georectified raster imagery to Spark SQL. It quantizes scenes into chunks called "tiles". Each tile contains a 2-D matrix of "cell" (pixel) values along with information on how to numerically interpret those cells. As shown in the figure below, a "RasterFrame" is a Spark DataFrame with one or more columns of type `tile`. A `tile` column typically represents a single frequency band of sensor data, such as "blue" or "near infrared", but can also be quality assurance information, land classification assignments, or any other rasterized spatiotemporal data. Along with `tile` columns there is typically an `extent` specifying the geographic location of the data, the map projection of that geometry (`crs`), and a `timestamp` column representing the acquisition time. These columns can all be used in the `WHERE` clause when filtering 

RasterFrames also includes support for working with vector data, such as [GeoJSON][GeoJSON]. You can use vector data to filter DataFrame rows, using geospatial predicates (e.g. contains, intersects, overlaps, etc.), to mask cells, and to be rasterized into training data appropriate for machine learning.


![RasterFrame Anatomy](static/rasterframe-anatomy.png)

Raster data can be read from a number of sources. Through the flexible Spark SQL DataSource API, RasterFrames can be constructed from collections of georectified imagery (including Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs or [COGS][COGS]), [GeoTrellis Layers][GTLayer], and from catalog of Landsat 8 and MODIS data sets on the [Amazon Web Services (AWS) Public Data Set (PDS)][PDS]. See @ref:[Raster Data I/O](raster-io.md) for details.
